SignXML is a free open source implementation of the XML Signature and XAdES standards. The SignXML project is staffed by
volunteers. If you are using this library in a for-profit project, please contribute to SignXML development and
maintenance using the "Sponsor" button on the SignXML GitHub project page, https://github.com/XML-Security/signxml. If
you are looking for support with your commercial XML Signature or XAdES based application, please donate and contact
SignXML developers using the issue tracker on the SignXML project page or the contact information listed in README.rst.
